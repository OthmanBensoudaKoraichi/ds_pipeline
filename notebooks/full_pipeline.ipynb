    "### 1️⃣ Look at your columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by listing and scanning all columns:\n",
    "- What does each column represent?\n",

    "- Are there columns that look redundant, constant, or suspicious?\n",

    "- Unexpected columns\n",
    "- Naming inconsistencies\n",
    "- Encoded information that needs clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Inspect distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "For each column, you should ask:\n",
    "- What are the typical values?\n",
    "- Are there outliers or extreme values?\n",
